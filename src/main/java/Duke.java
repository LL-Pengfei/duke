/* main function, support/enable the following functionalities:

1. initialize/greet/bye (Level-1) - initialize when programme starts
command: / - auto greet when programme starts
command: bye - will exit the programme

2. list (Level-2)
command: list - will return the list of the tasks stored

3. markAsDone (Level-3) - used Task class to implement
                        - allow marking as X or V
command: done int - will return "I've marked this task as done: ...

4. todo event deadline - support tracking different types of tasks (Level-4)
                       - implemented using inheritance to support
                       - multiple task types
command: todo sth - return added status + total task size (current)
command: deadline sth /by time - return added status + total task size (current)
command: event sth /at time - return added status + total task size (current)
** command has to be specific and sticks to the format specified in pt 8 **

5. Handle Errors (Level-5) - used Exceptions to handle errors
- define a class DukeException to represent exceptions specific to Duke
- currently support:
5.1 commands: done delete find todo event deadline //not followed by task number/task
    - currently can only handle empty commands, i.e. commands not followed by things that should follow
    - wrong ones still not dealt with (e.g. for deadline & event, if time format is wrong, not yet catchable)
5.2 non-sensical command/input e.g. blah -> only limited to one word command, no space
5.3 File IO Exception (persistent memory storage(pt 7)) - will catch if initial document is empty

6. Delete (Level-6)
command: delete int - return deleted status + total task size (current)

7. Save (Level-7)
- save the tasks in the hard disk automatically whenever the task list changes
- i.e. save after every command (implemented using while(true) loop and save at
- the end of completion of each command)
- also, load the data from the hard disk when Duke starts up
- file name & location hard-coded
- implemented using Serializable
ALSO, when doing Level-6, used Java Collections classes for storing data
- implemented using ArrayList<Task> to store the tasks

8. Dates and Time (Level-8)
- Deadline and Event time understood as time, not String
- support dates and time interpretations (at this moment, time only support round
- clock time, non-round clock time will round down to the round clock
- (e.g. 18:50 -> 18:00))
command: deadline(event) sth /by(at) D/M/YR TTTT (format)
sth /by D ||||| sth /at D -> space must have; must be this exact format
D/M/YR TTTT TTTT == 24 hour clock, no :
this will hence be interpreted into dates and time e.g. 2nd of December 2019, 6pm

9. Find (Level-9)
provide the capability to search for tasks that were recorded. Give users a
way to find a task by searching for a keyword
command: find sth (sth = any keyword) - return matching tasks list (number here
is not the number in the task list, but directly 1 2 3...)

9.5.1 A-TextUiTesting implemented, using Text UI Testing, test using the IO redirection technique
it now supports using the IO redirection technique to semi-automate testing of Duke
[automated testing of the Duke UI]
//need to update 9.5.1 after completing more oop section

9.5.2 A-MoreOOP implemented
Code refactored to extract out closely related code as classes
extracted out Ui Storage Parser Tasklist
